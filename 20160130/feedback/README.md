# Feedback for the Jan 2016 event

I (Glenn) sent surveys to both sponsors and attendees to solicit
feedback on the event and work out what we could improve. I said it
was anonymous, but neglected to inform people that their responses
would be shared.

As a result I've paraphrased and aggregated the responses by
question. The raw data can, in a couple of instances, allow
people who were there on the day to work out who answered the
survey.
