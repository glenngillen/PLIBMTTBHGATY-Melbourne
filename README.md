# PLIBMTTBHGATY Melbourne

This repo is a way to transparently document and share all of the things
required to host the Melbourne-based [PLIBMTTBHGATY](http://plibmttbhgaty.com/) meetup.
[Bo Jeanes](https://github.com/bjeanes) and [Glenn Gillen](https://github.com/glenngillen)
have hosted the only one to date, but the hope is by sharing all this information
publicly we're not seen as "owning" the event.

We happily encourage others to take the information provided here and go forth to
organise their own instances of the event.

## Hosting a meetup

If you're going to host a meetup feel free to either fork this repo and submit a pull-request
with the updated event information, or ping either Bo or Glenn to be added as a collaborator directly.
You'll also need one of us to give you access to the [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/PLIBMTTBHGATY-Melbourne/).

## Slack channel

There's a [Slack Team](https://plibmttbhgaty-melb.slack.com/) to let members talk to each other. Visit [https://floating-fortress-61274.herokuapp.com/](https://floating-fortress-61274.herokuapp.com/)
to invite yourself to the team if you don't already have access.
